				<p> This is my personal website.  My goal for the site was to have a place where I could display information about myself, the work I have done, and the projects I am currently working on.</p>
				<p>The website also provided me with an opportunity to try something different with the design and layout.  In designing the site, I wanted the focus to be on content.  I felt that using a minimalistic approach to the visible elements would make the content be more prominent.  I also wanted each section of the site to be visually identifiable, while keeping the minimalistic design.  To accomplish this, I used colors to identify the various portions of the site.</p>

			<div class="portfolio_title">Utah Valley University Virtual Tour</div>
			<div class="portfolio_text">
				<p> For our senior project, my group designed and created the UVU Virtual Tour for Utah Valley University.  It is a Adobe Flex based web application that uses XML driven content to load the text, and many of the images, and a CSS stylesheet to style the MXML components.</p>
				<p> My specific responsibility was in creating the functionality and animations for the initial map portion.</p>

				<p>Just about every web designer or developer has heard about the Zen Garden project (<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">www.csszengarden.com</a>).  It is a website that is based around the idea of multiple designers or developers creating various CSS stylesheets to change the look of the original zen garden HTML.</p>
				<p>This was the goals of one of my school projects, where our teacher provided the HTML and we had to create the CSS stylesheet and accompanying graphics.</p>

				<p> One of the first web design projects I had to do while in school was to choose a bed and breakfast website, and redesign it.  I chose the Red Brick Inn of Panguitch Utah, and created this design based on some of their existing content.</p>
