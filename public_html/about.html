			<p class="left aboutIntro">Hi, I’m Ryan.</p><!-- /Intro -->
			<p class="left aboutDesc">I’m a Web / Interaction Designer &#38; Developer living in Orem, Utah.  I enjoy crafting engaging web experiences using web standards like HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as Adobe’s Flash and Flex platforms.</p><!-- /Description -->
			<p class="paragraph left">I first became interested in the web in High School.  I took a class that covered basic HTML and Flash Animation, and since then I have been intrigued by the potential that it offers as a creative medium.  It is a space where art, design, and creativity are paired with information and technology; both of which I love.  I have enjoyed drawing since I was a kid, and have been interested in technology for just as long.  Working with the web has provided me a unique opportunity to use both, and do what I love for a living.</p><!-- /Text Block -->
			<p class="paragraph left">I attended college at Utah Valley University, studying Web and Interaction design in the Digital Media program and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 2010.  Since my graduation I have continued to explore the potential of the web, and continually try to learn more about the languages and design principles that are essential to creating an experience that people want to interact with.</p><!-- /Text Block -->
			<p class="paragraph left">Lastly, I believe that who we are is influenced by what we do.  In addition to my enthusiasm for the web, I love spending time with my wife Megan, and enjoy participating in many types of leisure activities.  I like to go camping, hiking and trail biking.  I also love to read, draw, play games (including card, board, and video games), and a myriad of other activities.</p><!-- /Text Block -->
