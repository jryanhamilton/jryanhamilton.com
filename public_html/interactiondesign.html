				<p> When I was at Enspark, we were hired by a client to create a Flash series of Flash based web banners based on their designs.  Shortly after completing the first couple rounds of banners, we were asked to create an alternative to the viewer available in Google's ClickOnce suite.  I was tasked with creating the initial mockups of the Banner Manager, and how we would want people to interact with it. </p>
				<p> When creating the mockup, I knew that we wanted to accomplish three things.  First, We wanted to have an intuitive interface that would easily convey the necessary information about the various banner types, and where they might eventually be placed be on a webpage.  Second, we wanted to utilize the available screen space as much as possible, while allowing the program to scale to fit on either a projector screen or computer monitor.  Lastly, we wanted to make sure that all of the information the client wanted to see was all available, while not taking large amounts of space.  This was the result. </p>

				<p> This is my personal website.  My goal for the site was to have a place where I could display information about myself, the work I have done, and the projects I am currently working on.</p>
				<p>The website also provided me with an opportunity to try something different with the design and layout.  In designing the site, I wanted the focus to be on content.  I felt that using a minimalistic approach to the visible elements would make the content be more prominent.  I also wanted each section of the site to be visually identifiable, while keeping the minimalistic design.  To accomplish this, I used colors to identify the various portions of the site.</p>
